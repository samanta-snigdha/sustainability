## 🌿 Real-World Plant Disease Detection using CNN

**🧩 Overview**

In sustainable agriculture, early and accurate detection of plant diseases is essential to reduce chemical usage, prevent yield loss, and ensure long-term food security.
However, most existing CNN-based models for crop disease detection are trained on controlled, laboratory datasets and fail to perform reliably in real-world farm conditions.
Variations in lighting, background clutter, and image quality lead to poor generalization and reduced accuracy.

Therefore, this project aims to develop a robust CNN-based model for real-world crop disease detection under uncontrolled environmental conditions, enabling continuous and reliable crop health monitoring to support sustainable farming practices.  


**🎯 Objectives**

Develop a CNN model for detecting crop diseases under real-world conditions.  
Improve model generalization and accuracy on uncontrolled datasets.  
Contribute to sustainable agriculture through efficient disease management.  


**⚙️ Tech Stack**

Programming Language: Python  
Frameworks: TensorFlow / Keras  
Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, scikit-learn  
Tools: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  


**📊 Dataset**

The project uses real-world plant disease datasets such as:

Plant Disease Prediction  
Plant Leaf Diseases Training Dataset  
Plant Disease Expert  
Plant Disease Recognition Dataset  
 

**🧠 Model Workflow**

Data Collection & Preprocessing — Clean and prepare images for CNN input.  
Data Augmentation — Simulate real-world variations (lighting, angles, noise).  
Model Building — Use CNN architecture (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet, or custom).  
Training & Validation — Evaluate on both controlled and real-world data.  
Performance Analysis — Measure accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.  


**🌱 Sustainability Impact**
